        <p>"Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.</p>
        <p>I'm not cute or built to fit a fashion model's size</p> 
        <p>But when I start to tell them,</p> 
        <p>They think I'm telling lies, </p>
        <p>I say,</p> 
        <p>It's in the reach of my arms, </p>
        <p>The stride of my step,</p> 
        <p>The curl of my lips.</p> 
        <p>I'm a Woman</p>
        <p>Pheneomenally.</p>
        <p> <span>Phenomenal woman,</span> </p>  
        <p><span>That's me.</span></p>

       <h1> My Poem</h1>
       <h3>Marching For America</h3>
       <p>It saddens me that we must march again.</p>
       <p>Collaborating with unique skins,</p>
       <p>to paint a picture oof our America.</p>
       <p>Reinforcing how perfectly different and special we are</p>
       <p>all together.</p>
       <p>It saddens me that we must do this again.</p>
       <p>Fighting peacefully with our hearts and fire in our eyes,</p>
       <p>to show how woman are people too.</p>
       <p>We have skin and bones, and we hurt like everyone else.</p>
       <p>That when you identify as LGBTQ+, you are loved unconditionally.</p>
       <p>Because no matter your identification, you are human.</p>
       <p>We must show again and again that we are not just groups of people.</p>
       <p>But individual flowers who bloom with the grace that paints the picture of our America.</p>
       <p>We must march again.</p>
       <p>To show how not everyone has the same opinion,</p>
       <p>but that human rights is not an opinion.</p>
       <p>That Muslims are people with skin and bones;</p>
       <p>with feelings and are not the poster child for terrorism.</p>
       <p>When we paint the picture of America,</p>
       <p>it is not fair-skinned.</p>
       <p>Different culutres and races make our picture stand out against the rest of the world.</p>
       <p>We define America as embracing all humans with skin and bones.</p>
       <p>That the soul inside the person is more important than their physical attributes.</p>
       <p>Not everything is about the white person. Not everything is about you.</p>
       <p>Educate yourself and grow the empathetic muscle that many do not have.</p>
       <p>Look at our picture of America.</p>
       <p>Stare at the beauty that our melting pot has created.</p>
       <p>And realize that we must march again.</p>
       <p>To redefine the meaning of our flag.</p>
