        <h1 style="font-family: monospace;">Classroom Management Tools</h1>
            <h4>I have gathered several management techniques over the years of observing and teaching.</h4>
            <h4>I chose two to start with and will add more later.</h4>

        <h1 style="font-family: monospace;"><li>Class Dojo</li></h1>
            <p>Class Dojo is a software where a teacher can track students who are showing classroom values. </p>
            <p> It is also a great tool for communication between the teacher and the caretaker.</p>
        <h2 style="font-family: monospace;">Point System</h2>
            <p>Each time a kid does something that represents the classroom values, the teacher can give them a point.</p>
            <p>Individual points add up to create a whole classroom score.</p>
            <p>As the teacher, you can choose what reward to give to the students that reach a certain point value.</p>
        <h2 style="font-family: monospace;">Communication</h2>
            <p>As a closed communication system, Class Dojo is a safe way to communicate between care giver and teacher.</p>
            <p>There is a choice to create a whole group message and individual messages.</p>
            <p>The whole group messaging system is great for sending weekly letters out to care givers.</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">It is important to communicate regularly with families</p>
            <p>Individual communication comes in handy when you need to contact care givers about their child between Parent Teacher Conferences.</p>
        <h2 style="font-family: monospace;">Rating</h2>
            <p> I would rate this program as a classroom management tool a 7 out of 10 if used effectivly.</p>

        <h1 style="font-family: monospace;"><li>Mystery Trash</li></h1>
            <p>Mystery Trash is a tool to use when cleaning the classroom. This task is performed at the end of the day.</p>
        <h2 style="font-family: monospace;">Directions</h2>
            <p>One student is chosen to be the Mystery Trash picker. They will locate a piece of trash in their mind and the other students must find that piece of trash.</p>
            <p>If the trash is found, the winner gets to pick out a prize from the treasure box.</p>
            <p>Remember: Prizes do not have to be big. Kids get excited over a hi-chew.</p>
